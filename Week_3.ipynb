    "## 01 Assignment\r\n",
    "1. Create 3 classes: Student, DataSheet and Course\r\n",
    "2. A student has a data_sheet and a data_sheet has multiple courses in particular order\r\n",
    "3. Each course has name, classroom, teacher, ETCS and optional grade if course is taken.\r\n",
    "4. In Student create init() so that a Student can be initiated with name, gender, data_sheet and image_url\r\n",
    "5. In DataSheet create a method to get_grades_as_list()\r\n",
    "6. In student create a method: get_avg_grade()\r\n",
    "7. Create a function that can generate n number of students with random: name, gender, courses (from a fixed list of course names), grades, img_url\r\n",
    "    1. Let the function write the result to a csv file with format stud_name, course_name, teacher, ,gender, ects, classroom, grade, img_url\r\n",
    "8. Read student data into a list of Students from a csv file (Each student can appear on multiple lines):\r\n",
    "    1. loop through the list and print each student with name, img_url and avg_grade.\r\n",
    "    2. sort the list by avg_grade\r\n",
    "    3. create a bar chart with student_name on x and avg_grade on y-axis\r\n",
    "9. Make a method on Student class that can show progression of the study in % (add up ECTS from all passed courses divided by total of 150 total points (equivalent to 5 semesters))\r\n",
    "10. Show a bar chart of distribution of study progression on x-axis and number of students in each category on y-axis. (e.g. make 10 categories from 0-100%)  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Extra: Make the Datasheet class iterable so that next(data_sheet) will return the next course in the list\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 02 Status\r\n",
    "I feel as a lot of these assignments are left to be interpreted, which leaves room for error.  \r\n",
    "One such case could be 7.A (7.1), what if a student has multiple courses, how would this be written into a CSV format?  \r\n",
    "I feel that spending more time to figure out *what* the assignment wants you to do compared to actually coding it, is quite tedious."
